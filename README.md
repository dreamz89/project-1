### Approach

Step-by-Step Process

* Create cover page that will disappear upon clicking start button
* Generate fishes at intervals
* Stop generating fishes after the 40th fish
* Fishes must be of different sizes, different initial position, and move randomly
* Create main fish that follows mouse
* Keep track of collision and increase size of main fish
* Win/Lose

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your GitHub repo
* A **git repository hosted on GitHub**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.
